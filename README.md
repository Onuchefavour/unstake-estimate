# Unstake Estimate

A powerful blockchain-based liquidity and reward estimation toolkit for decentralized staking ecosystems

This project is built with Clarity smart contracts for the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

Unstake Estimate provides a comprehensive toolkit for accurately predicting and calculating staking rewards, liquidity positions, and unstaking mechanics. The platform leverages blockchain technology to ensure transparent, secure, and precise financial estimations for decentralized finance participants.

## Core Features

- Advanced liquidity estimation
- Precise reward calculation algorithms
- Multi-token staking support
- Flexible unstaking mechanics
- Risk assessment and projection
- Historical performance tracking

## Architecture

The platform consists of three main smart contracts that work together:

### 1. Unstake Core (`unstake-core`)
- Primary contract managing core unstaking logic
- Handles unstaking requests and validations
- Manages liquidity pool interactions
- Supports complex unstaking scenarios

### 2. Liquidity Estimator (`liquidity-estimator`)
- Provides advanced liquidity position calculations
- Estimates potential rewards and risks
- Tracks liquidity trends and movements
- Supports multi-token liquidity analysis

### 3. Reward Calculator (`reward-calculator`)
- Generates precise reward projections
- Tracks historical staking performance
- Implements dynamic reward calculation
- Supports complex reward distribution models

## Smart Contract Functions

### Unstaking Core
```clarity
;; Initiate unstaking process
(initiate-unstake 
  (stake-amount uint)
  (stake-token (string-ascii 20))
  (unstake-duration uint))

;; Calculate projected unstake rewards
(estimate-unstake-rewards
  (stake-amount uint)
  (stake-token (string-ascii 20))
  (duration uint))

;; Verify unstaking eligibility
(check-unstake-eligibility
  (user principal)
  (stake-token (string-ascii 20)))
```

### Liquidity Estimation
```clarity
;; Get current liquidity position
(get-liquidity-position 
  (user principal)
  (token (string-ascii 20)))

;; Estimate potential impermanent loss
(estimate-impermanent-loss
  (token-a (string-ascii 20))
  (token-b (string-ascii 20))
  (liquidity-amount uint))

;; Predict future liquidity trends
(predict-liquidity-trend 
  (token (string-ascii 20))
  (time-horizon uint))
```

### Reward Calculation
```clarity
;; Calculate historical staking performance
(calculate-staking-performance 
  (user principal)
  (token (string-ascii 20)))

;; Estimate annualized percentage yield
(estimate-apy 
  (token (string-ascii 20))
  (stake-amount uint))

;; Simulate reward scenarios
(simulate-reward-scenario
  (stake-amount uint)
  (token (string-ascii 20))
  (scenario-type (string-ascii 20)))
```

## Getting Started

1. Deploy the smart contracts in the following order:
   - `unstake-core`
   - `liquidity-estimator`
   - `reward-calculator`

2. Initialize staking parameters:
```clarity
(contract-call? unstake-core set-global-parameters 
  u1000 ; minimum stake
  u100000 ; maximum stake
  true) ; enable advanced mode
```

3. Estimate unstaking rewards:
```clarity
(contract-call? reward-calculator estimate-apy 
  "STX"
  u50000)
```

## Security Considerations

- Advanced access control mechanisms
- Comprehensive input validation
- Protection against economic attacks
- Transparent reward calculation
- Rigorous parameter constraints
- Audit-ready design patterns

## Future Enhancements

- Cross-chain staking support
- Machine learning reward predictions
- Dynamic risk assessment
- Advanced liquidity optimization
- Integration with DeFi protocols
